# IMPORTANT NOTE

Thanks to [kukukk](https://github.com/kukukk) pull request, the plugin now support Android devices also. I have created a new repository with Android support here - https://github.com/an-rahulpandey/cordova-plugin-mediapicker. The code in that repository has not been tested or checked. If you are using that version and found any issues, please file the bug report there. Also if you have fixed some issues found in the plugin, then please send a PR.

# Description

The plugin allows you to select the song from iOS music library and copy it in your app Document directory. Then you can use the [cordova media plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media) to play the song. Check the demo on how to play a song via media plugin.
